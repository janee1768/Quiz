📄 Description
The Quiz Application is a fun and interactive Python program that presents users with a list of multiple-choice questions. Each question has four options (A, B, C, D), and the user must type the correct option letter.

Here’s how it works:

1.A list of questions is stored in a dictionary format with the question, its options, and the correct answer.

2.The program loops through each question one by one.

3.It displays the question and options, then waits for the user to input their answer.

4.If the answer is correct, the program says “Correct!” and increases the score.

5.If the answer is wrong, it shows the correct option.

6.At the end, the program displays the total score and thanks the user for playing.
